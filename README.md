•	Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
•	What did you do particularly well?
•	Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
•	Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
•	What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
•	How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

•	This program analyzes the text records that a company generates throughout the day. These records list items purchased in chronological order from the time the store opens to the time it closes. It rearranges their produce section based on how often items are purchased so they can create the most effective layout for their customers.
•	I managed to create a function that reads the input file and count the frequency of each word particularly well. I believe that the function I created to print a histogram of the items from the input file was also executed well.
•	After running this program, I realize improvements could be made by using exception handlers and validating inputs because the program only recognizes inputs that begin with Upper case characters. 
•	The most challenging pieces of code were the functions that updates the item frequency, prints the histogram, and prints the frequency of all the items from the input file. I found resources from C++ libraries and video tutorials.
•	The skills I found to be most transferable from this project are attention to detail, research, and planning. For this project, I had to plan and design the layout for the program that would be the best solution to the problem outlined. I also researched how to implement functions that were needed.
•	I’ve decided to create smaller functions individually outside the main function for simplicity and readability. Each function is reusable, scalable, and adaptable.
